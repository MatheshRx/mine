		<p id="p1">Now what is Bootstrap? Well, Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. And this is a direct quote from the Bootstrap website. Let's take it apart a little bit. First of all, it's the most popular framework. While GitHub, which is basically a large website with code repository that has a social component to it, has over 90,000 stars or likes of the Bootstrap project. So it's the most popular project on the entire website. And it's been forked over 38,000 times.</p>
		<p id="p2">Bootstrap consists mostly of CSS. It pre-defines a lot of CSS classes for you. So you know, a lot of the times, especially with a user interface that's a bit more complex than just a single HTML element or something, CSS needs to target a certain HTML structure. Well because of that reason, Bootstrap often times requires you to have a particular HTML structure in your HTML page. In practice, however, it's not as scary as that sounds. It doesn't really invade your HTML code and make you write some crazy HTML constructs. It just asks you to add an extra div here and there and give it a particular class so that the CSS Bootstrap defined would apply properly. Its JavaScript framework shouldn't be overlooked either</p><section>hello world!...</section>
